<summary><strong>Story point estimation guide</strong></summary>

**Story points are relative (not hours).** Use them to express overall effort/complexity/uncertainty.

**Use this as a guide for populating _Projects → Estimate_ during Sprint Planning:**
- **?**: not enough info to estimate (needs clarification/spike)
- **½–1**: tiny, well understood, low risk
- **2–3**: small, straightforward, some unknowns
- **5**: medium, multiple steps, needs testing
- **8**: large, design decisions / more moving parts
- **13**: very large, high uncertainty — consider splitting
- **20/40/100**: too big/uncertain — break down before committing
- **∞**: unbounded/unestimable as written (re-scope)

<summary><strong>Bug report checklist</strong></summary>

To make this bug easy to reproduce and verify:

- **Expected vs actual**: what should happen vs what happened
- **Repro steps**: minimal steps to reproduce
- **Environment/version**: device/OS/app version/commit/build
- **Evidence**: logs, screenshots, error messages
- **Fix criteria**: how we’ll know it’s fixed (ideally a regression test)

Tip: if this blocks a current Feature/Epic, link it in the issue body or add it as a sub-issue.

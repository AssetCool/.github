This repository contains **organisation-level defaults** for GitHub issue templates and related settings.  
These defaults apply across the organisation, but can be **overridden in an individual repository** by adding repo-specific templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Which issue type should I use?

See the [Issue Advice page](./ISSUE_ADVICE.md) for guidance.

This repository contains **organisation-level defaults** for GitHub issue templates and related settings.  
These defaults apply across the organisation, but can be **overridden in an individual repository** by adding repo-specific templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Which issue/template type should I use?

See the [Issue/Template Advice page](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE_ADVICE.md) for guidance.

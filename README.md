# .github

This repository contains **organisation-level defaults** for GitHub issue templates and related settings.
These defaults apply across the organisation, but can be **overridden in an individual repository** by adding repo-specific templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Which issue type should I use?

Use the template that best matches the size and intent of the work:

### 🗺️ Epic

Use an Epic for a **single, coherent outcome** that will take **multiple sprints** and will be delivered through multiple **Features** (which then break down into Tasks). An Epic should describe the *why*, the *scope boundaries*, and what “done” looks like — it’s not a general bucket for unrelated work.

When you create an Epic, here’s what “good” looks like for each field:

#### Outcome / goal
**What are we trying to achieve, for whom, and why now?**

Example:
- **Outcome:** Operators can start/stop key subsystems remotely and confirm execution without being onsite.
- **Stakeholders / users impacted:** Field operators, support engineers, on-call.
- **Why now:** Reduces site visits during winter deployments; current process is slow and error-prone.
- **How we’ll measure success (optional):** 80% fewer “onsite required” interventions for routine operations; mean time to recover from operator error reduced by 50%.

#### Scope
**High-level “in vs out” boundaries so the Epic stays manageable.**

Example:
- **In scope:**
  - Remote start/stop for pump + basic safety interlocks
  - Display current state + last command result
  - Basic access control (operator vs admin)
- **Out of scope:**
  - Full role-based permissions matrix
  - Advanced analytics dashboards
  - Offline-first operation / store-and-forward control

#### Exit criteria (definition of done)
**Clear conditions for closing the Epic.**

Example:
- All planned **Feature sub-issues** are completed and accepted
- Critical docs updated (operator notes + runbook)
- Health checks and alerts added for the new control path
- Demo completed with a real robot + sign-off from ops/support

#### Epic Priority
**How urgently we need the outcome.**

Example:
- **Urgent**: blocks a customer delivery / safety issue / repeated incidents
- **High**: needed for next milestone
- **Normal**: valuable, but not time-critical
- **Low**: nice-to-have / opportunistic

#### Target window
**A rough delivery window (prefer ranges).**

Example:
- `Sprint 14–16`
- `Q1`
- `Before March field trials`

#### Dependencies / risks
**Anything that could block delivery or introduce uncertainty.**

Example:
- **Dependencies:**
  - API contract from telemetry service
  - Hardware availability for validation tests
  - Security review for remote control path
- **Risks:**
  - Unknown failure modes on poor connectivity
  - Safety interlocks need careful validation
  - Cross-repo coordination could slow integration
- **Mitigations (optional):**
  - Run a spike Feature to prototype comms behaviour
  - Add staged rollout + feature flag

---

### Examples (written as outcomes)

**Remote operations MVP**
- Outcome: “As a field operator, I can perform the core remote actions safely and verify they happened.”
- Likely Features:
  - Operator can start/stop pump remotely (happy path)
  - Operator can view current state + last command result
  - Basic faults visible + clear error messages

**Telemetry pipeline v2**
- Outcome: “As support/on-call, we can trust telemetry is captured, searchable, and exportable during incidents.”
- Likely Features:
  - Export telemetry for time range
  - Buffering/retry when offline
  - Schema/versioning so fields don’t silently break

**Reliability & watchdog improvements**
- Outcome: “The system detects failures quickly and recovers automatically with clear diagnostics.”
- Likely Features:
  - Service health endpoint + status page
  - Watchdog integration + restart policy
  - Alerting when telemetry stops / critical services restart

✅ After creating the Epic, add it to the appropriate **Project** (right-hand sidebar → **Projects**) and create the Features as **sub-issues** of the Epic.

### 💡 Feature

Use this when you want to describe a **chunk of added value** from a stakeholder’s point of view — something someone can do afterwards that they couldn’t do before (or can do more easily/safely). A Feature should be **small enough to complete within one sprint**.

A Feature should be written as a **user story** (who / what / why) with **user-facing acceptance criteria**. It is then broken down into **Tasks** (implementation steps). The stakeholder might be a customer/operator, but it can also be an internal stakeholder (e.g., a developer, support engineer, or operations).

#### Example Features and how to fill in the template fields

Below are the same examples explaining what “good” looks like for the fields specified.

## Example 1: Emergency stop via RC transmitter

**Title**
- `💡 [FEATURE] - RC emergency stop to put bot in safe state`

**User story**
- As a **field operator**, I want to **stop all actuation of a bot using an RC transmitter**, so that I can **put the bot into a safe state**.

**Parent Epic**
- `#82` (Remote operations MVP)  
  *(or paste the full Epic URL if needed)*

**Acceptance criteria (user-facing, testable)**
- AC1: When the operator activates the RC e-stop, the bot enters **Safe State** within **≤ 500 ms**.
- AC2: In Safe State, **all actuation outputs** are disabled (drive, pumps, valves, etc.) until explicitly cleared.
- AC3: The UI/telemetry exposes `safe_state = true` and a timestamp for the last e-stop event.
- AC4: If RC signal is lost for **> N ms**, the bot defaults to Safe State (fail-safe).
- AC5: A clear operator message is presented for Safe State entry and exit (no silent transitions).

**Notes / design / links**
- Context: We’ve had near-miss incidents during testing; need a fast, independent safety override.
- Approach:
  - Define Safe State semantics (what “actuation disabled” means per subsystem).
  - RC receiver input → debounced e-stop signal → safety controller → broadcast state.
- Links:
  - Safety requirements doc: …
  - Firmware/IO mapping: …
  - Related issues: #105 (RC receiver integration), #106 (telemetry field additions)

## Example 2: Export telemetry for a time range

**Title**
- `💡 [FEATURE] - Export telemetry for a selected time range`

**User story**
- As a **support engineer**, I want to **export telemetry for a selected time range**, so that I can **diagnose incidents and share evidence quickly**.

**Parent Epic**
- `#140` (Telemetry pipeline v2)

**Acceptance criteria**
- AC1: Support can select a **start/end time** and export telemetry as **CSV** (minimum) via CLI or UI.
- AC2: Export includes **timestamps**, **unit-labelled fields**, and the **robot identifier**.
- AC3: Export completes within **≤ 60 seconds** for a 1-hour window on a typical robot dataset (or provides progress indication).
- AC4: If data is missing, the export clearly indicates gaps (e.g., missing intervals, “no data available”).
- AC5: Output is deterministic and shareable: same inputs → same file content (ordering + formatting consistent).

**Notes / design / links**
- Context: Current investigations require manual log pulling and bespoke scripts.
- Approach:
  - Define export schema (columns + units).
  - Add filter-by-time query (DuckDB/SQLite/TSDB depending on stack).
  - Add a “share bundle” option later (out of scope for this Feature).
- Links:
  - Incident postmortem: …
  - Telemetry schema repo/docs: …
  - UX mock (if UI): …

## Example 3: Camera health status visibility

**Title**
- `💡 [FEATURE] - Display camera health status (online/FPS/last frame time)`

**User story**
- As an **operator**, I want to **see camera health status (online/offline, FPS, last frame time)**, so that I can **spot failures before they affect a mission**.

**Parent Epic**
- `#201` (Operational observability improvements)

**Acceptance criteria**
- AC1: Operator can view camera status: **Online/Offline**, **FPS**, and **Last frame received timestamp**.
- AC2: If no frame is received for **> 2 seconds**, status becomes **Degraded**; for **> 10 seconds**, **Offline**.
- AC3: Status updates at least every **5 seconds** without needing a manual refresh.
- AC4: Status is visible in both **local UI** and **remote UI** (if applicable) with the same semantics.
- AC5: A clear warning indicator is shown when status is Degraded/Offline (no hidden failures).

**Notes / design / links**
- Context: Operators often only notice camera failure after downstream perception breaks.
- Approach:
  - Source truth for “camera alive” (frame timestamps from acquisition pipeline).
  - Define thresholds for degraded/offline.
  - Expose a single health endpoint + UI widget.
- Links:
  - Existing healthcheck endpoint: …
  - Camera pipeline module docs: …
  - Related bugs: #317 (sporadic FPS drops)

## Example 4: Run full test suite in CI on every PR

**Title**
- `💡 [FEATURE] - Run full test suite in CI on every PR`

**User story**
- As a **developer**, I want to **run the full test suite in CI on every PR**, so that I can **catch regression issues before I merge**.

**Parent Epic**
- `#55` (Engineering effectiveness / build reliability)

**Acceptance criteria**
- AC1: On PR open/update, CI runs **build + unit tests** (minimum) and reports pass/fail in GitHub checks.
- AC2: CI finishes within **≤ 20 minutes** for the standard PR path (or provides a fast/slow split).
- AC3: Failures provide actionable output (test name, logs/artifacts retained for ≥ 7 days).
- AC4: The main branch is protected so PRs require CI passing before merge (where appropriate).
- AC5: A developer can reproduce CI locally using documented instructions (dev container / script / make target).

**Notes / design / links**
- Context: Regressions are being found late; we need earlier feedback.
- Approach:
  - Add CI workflow(s): build matrix, caching, test execution.
  - Define minimum required checks and branch protection rules.
- Links:
  - CI proposal doc: …
  - Existing workflow files: …
  - Tooling: CMake presets / colcon config / test harness docs: …

✅ After creating the Feature, add it to the appropriate **Project** using the right-hand sidebar → **Projects**.  
N.B. If you have linked the Feature to a Parent Epic that is already part of this project, the Feature should inherit this.

At Sprint Planning, once the issue is moved to **Ready**, please ensure that a **Priority** is assigned and an **Estimate** is given (using your team guide). If you’re not sure which Project to use, email engineering@assetcool.com.


### 🧩 Task
Use this for a **small, concrete unit of implementation work**, usually completed within a sprint and often as part of a Feature.

Typical examples:
- Add a unit test for a module
- Implement a single API method
- Refactor a component, update a dependency, add logging

Best practice: create Tasks as **sub-issues of a Feature** where possible.

### 🐛 Bug Report
Use this when something is broken, unreliable, or behaving incorrectly in an existing system (i.e. not “new work”, but a defect).

When you raise a bug, please fill in the template fields so someone else can reproduce and verify the fix:

Description: what’s wrong, in one or two sentences.

Reproduction steps: minimal steps to reliably trigger the problem.

Expected vs actual: what should happen vs what does happen.

Environment / version: device/OS/service version/commit/build (anything that might affect reproducibility).

Screenshots / Logs: supporting evidence (error text, stack traces, photos, etc.).

Fix criteria: how we’ll know it’s fixed (e.g., no longer repros; regression test added).

More descriptive examples:

**“Pump start command returns ‘OK’, but the pump never starts.”**

- Reproduction: send StartPump via UI → observe no movement

- Expected: pump starts within 2s and state becomes Running

- Actual: state flips to Running but hardware remains off

- Env/version: Jetson Orin NX / Ubuntu 22.04 / bot_system vX.Y (commit …)

- Logs: include CAN frames / controller logs

**“Telemetry drops out after ~10 minutes of running.”**

- Reproduction: run system for 10–15 mins → telemetry stream stops

- Expected: continuous telemetry at configured rate

- Actual: MQTT topic stops publishing; UI shows stale values

- Env/version: Jetson Orin NX / Ubuntu 22.04 / bot_system vX.Y (commit …) / network type (Wi-Fi) / bot_system vX.Y (commit …)

- Logs: MQTT client logs

**“Clicking ‘Save settings’ crashes the app.”**

- Reproduction: open Settings → change parameter → click Save

- Expected: settings persist and success message shown

- Actual: app crashes / throws exception

- Evidence: screenshot/video + stack trace

- Fix criteria: add regression test; no crash; settings persist across restart
